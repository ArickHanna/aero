#Overview/Company Info
  Aeroapps Technology was found by Bryan Tregila and Ed Gonzalez. It is a company that primarily foceses on developing customized iOS and web aplication for the aviation industry. It also provides Reva SMS Forms Manager that help flight crews to complete and submit their flight risk assessments and safety reports. It also created interactive aircraft instrument panel for student pilots who are preparing for FAA exams to learn aircraft systems. Aeroapps is asking for an adaptive learning mobile application to be built for them that will integrate a database that we will also create to facilitate the certification process for pilots in training. 
#Database Requirements
  The database will comprise of data and information already provided to us by aeroapps. The primary data to be integrated includes: FAA Handbooks and Manuals, FAA question bank for testing, aircraft performance tables, aircraft weight & balance tables, and airport information. The FAA question bank is currently located on an Excel file. This Excel file must be transferred, preferably on MySQL, so that it may be accessed through the backend server with ease. Any documents uploaded to the database will be accessed through a web portal where admin users have the ability to add, delete, or modify documents.
